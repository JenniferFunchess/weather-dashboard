Description

It is time to conquer sever-side APIs! We have transition from web APIs to third party APIs now to server-side APIs. This week's assignment is a big step to start learning more about back end developement. With thousands of sever-side API's there are in the world right now, this week we focused on OpenWeather.

This assigment was a four step process. Step one is always to pseudocode your project. Once I have an outline of how I will generate my website, it is time to move into creating the HTML. It was important to create two different containers in this assignment so you have one that is strictly for generating data and one for saving to localStorage. Once I had my HTML set up it was time to move to CSS. I used CSS to put things in place and fix the smaller details like fonts styles and sizes. After my general outline of the broswer was completed, it was time to move into Javascript/jquery. I had to call in three different OpenWeather APIs for this webiste. I called one specifically for the current weather data, one for the current UV rating, and one for the future forecast. The most difficult part about this assignment was making sure each API call worked. Once it was synced to the browser, the calls followed suit.

It is important to be able to integrate server APIs into your work so you can have access from thousands of pre-made data generators. Being able to dynamically generate sever API's into your javascript brings your website to the next level.

There are many potential future projects we can use with this assignment. We can add in different API's such as Google Maps to locate the city you have chosen. You can also add this content in with a travel API so when you look up flights somewhere the weather will be displayed during your trip at the bottom of the page.

Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
